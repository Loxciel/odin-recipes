            <li>Transfer and spread proofed bread into a baking dish with 5-6 teaspoons of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Cover and let proof for 4-5 hours in a warm place.</li>
            <li>Top with extra herbs, vegetables, toppings if desired.</li>
            <li>Drizzle olive oil over the proofed dough and create dimples by pressing down with fingers.</li>
